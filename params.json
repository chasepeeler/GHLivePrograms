  "body": "# I have a lot of things planned for this app!\r\n\r\n1. **Ability to set an additional reminder on a per program basis a few minutes before it starts.** This would be available from the timeline pin as an additional action, and the user would be able to specify how many minutes before the start of the program the alert would happen\r\n2. **Ability to view the full schedule** The ability to actually see the schedule inside the watch app.\r\n3. **Crowd sourced categorization** The current categories are based on keywords in the title. This isn't the best method, and leaves a good number of programs that fall into the \"Other\" category. It also only really allows each program to be in one category. Utilizing the ability of users to specify what categories a program should go under would be much better - however, it will require a large user base before it can be effective.\r\n4. **Ability to get notified based on favorite songs** I believe there are already some crowd sourced databases out there which help link songs and programs. Whether I utilize one of those, or build my own, it would be nice if you could be notified when there is a program that is likely to play your favorite song.\r\n\r\n**If you have any other ideas or feedback, please let me know. You can submit any bugs, feature requests, or questions [here](https://github.com/chasepeeler/GHLivePrograms/issues/new)**",
